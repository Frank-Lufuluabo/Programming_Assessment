## Overview 

This project covers the implementation of recursive algorithms, searching and sorting techniques, and fundamental data structures (lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs). It also applies these concepts to solve real-world problems and analyzes their efficiency using Big-O notation.

## Contents

- Recursive Algorithms – Factorial & Fibonacci

- Sorting & Searching – Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Binary Search

- Data Structures – Linked List, Stack, Queue

- Trees – Binary Search Tree (insert, delete, traversals)

- Graphs – Adjacency Matrix, DFS, BFS, shortest path problem
